<h1>Hi, I'm Joe!</h1><h2><br/>Data Scientist | Experienced Banking Professional | Fraud & Financial Crime Specialist</h2>

<p>I’m a data scientist with over 10 years’ experience in banking, focusing on fraud prevention, AML, and customer identity.  
Currently developing and applying machine learning and data-driven insights to real-world financial crime and risk management challenges.</p>

<h2>👨‍💻 Machine Learning & Analytics Projects:</h2>
  
- [Customer Marketing Optimisation (Learning Project)](https://github.com/JoeAchira/Segmentation-Prj/blob/main/README.md) | Performed customer segmentation using K-Means and PCA to uncover behaviour-based clusters for targeted engagement.
Delivered actionable insights by profiling each segment and visualising cluster separation with dimensionality reduction.
  
- [Student Dropout Prediction (Learning Project)](https://github.com/JoeAchira/Neural-Network-prj/blob/main/README.md) | Predicted student dropout risk using XGBoost on a highly imbalanced dataset, leveraging ROC-AUC optimisation and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation.
Identified key academic and behavioural drivers using feature importance and model interpretation.
  
- [Book Sales Forecasting (Learning Project)](https://github.com/JoeAchira/Time-Series-Project/blob/main/README.md) | Forecasted weekly book sales for The Very Hungry Caterpillar and The Alchemist using statistical (SARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM) models.
Developed a hybrid ensemble that achieved the best accuracy by combining linear and non-linear pattern learning.

- [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/JoeAchira/Credit_card_anomaly_detection/blob/main/README.md) |
  Built and compared supervised (XGBoost, Logistic Regression) and unsupervised (Isolation Forest) models for detecting fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced datasets.
  Focused on improving recall and ROC-AUC through feature engineering and resampling methods.
  
- [Transaction Monitoring Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/JoeAchira/Transaction-Monitoring/blob/main/README.md) |
  Developed an unsupervised anomaly detection model to flag unusual banking activity for Transaction Monitoring use cases.
  Used Isolation Forest and clustering techniques to identify behavioural outliers and minimise false positives.

<!-- Customer Churn Prediction | Built a machine learning model to predict customer churn using behavioural and demographic variables.
Used XGBoost, feature importance, and SHAP analysis to highlight factors driving attrition and support retention strategy. -->
